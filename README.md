# Sensitivity-Analysis-of-Physical-and-Mental-Health-Factors-Affecting-PCOS-in-Women
This repository contains the executable codes and datasets, along with explanatory video for the paper title "Sensitivity analysis of physical and mental health factors affecting Polycystic ovary syndrome in women" (https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.13413)

  Steps to execute:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Use any iPython environment (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab) to execute the .ipynb files (PCOS_Paper_Physical_Factors_Code.ipynb, PCOS_Paper_Mental_Factors_Code.ipynb) separately for reproducing the output for the physical and mental fators respectively
  3. The results are directly printed in the notebooks and can be verified to match with those reported in the paper
  4. The csv files physical.csv and mentaldata.csv are the datasets, to be loaded in the iPython environment as inputs for execution of the above notebooks for reproducing the results of the physical factors and mental health factors respectively.
